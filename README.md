# Electric Vehicles: Access and Equitability

## Executive Summary

On April 16, 2021, The Washington state legislature passed the Clean Cars 2030 bill, which will require that by 2030, all new light-duty vehicles sold or registered in the state be electric, with the exception of emergency vehicles. The bill outlines a transition period and calls for a number of impact studies to be completed before 2030, including an analysis centered on "equity, especially including disadvantaged and low-income communities, communities of color, and rural communities, and strategies for maximizing equity in implementation of the 2030 requirement," among other research.

In this work, we initiate an impact study that explores 3 areas:
1. The relationship between electric vehicle ownership and economic means
2. Access to charging facilities and the concept of 'garage orphan'
3. Networking of charging stations and 'range anxiety'

We find that 73% of electric vehicles (EVs) in WA state are owned in zipcodes with median income higher than the state median income. Growth in EV ownership the higher income zipcodes occurs at a faster rate as well. Over the last 10 years, 72% of housing permits in Seattle have been for non-single-family-housing, which is great for home ownership but underscores the need for equitable access to charging facilities across economic means. Large swathes of the state lack a well-connected charging station network, feeding into owners' range anxiety.

Electric vehicles are the future. Consumers are interested in the greatly reduced fueling costs, minimal parts and maintenance, reduced carbon emissions, and exhilirating acceleration and power. The US big 3 automakers are chasing Tesla's dominance in the EV space:

Best of all, rebates and incentives save you money when you purchase or lease a new EV, helping make your transaction more affordable.

However, one of the most commonly cited barriers is the uncertainty associated with needing access to charging facilities for PEV drivers to plug in their vehicles (range anxiety). EV charging companies, towns and municipalities, individual businesses, local and federal government, are all interested in providing servies and capitalizing on this projected need. But how many and what kind of charging stations are needed? Where and how often do PEV drivers charge? The charging model for EVs is very dissimilar to that for fossil fuel vehicles, with charging time dependent on charger type and battery capacity. Therefore it's not as simple as adding EV charging stations to gas stations. The user's charging behavior will vary depending on where they live, where they work, and their travel patterns. Other than at home or at the workplace (primary and secondary charging locations), charging also occurs at individual charging stations at different parking lots. There are lots of logistical questions to answer, but what is clear is that publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure will need to be expanded.

**In this project, I will develop a proposal for EV charging station distribution in WA state over time until 2030, based on historical and projected EV sales in WA and the current EV charging station distribution in WA.**
